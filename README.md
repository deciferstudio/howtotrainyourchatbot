## How To Train Your Chatbot

How To Train Your Chatbot is a playable explainer built by Decifer Studio (Alia ElKattan, Lujain Ibrahim) to demystify how LLMs and conversational agents work, and how they don't work. This work was made possible through funding from the Responsible Technology Youth Power Fund, web development by Sarah Al Yahya, and illustrations & animations by Ramin Rahni.
