I played around with a few differen thing (I've left whatever stuff I didn't like as much in 'not using' - if you poke around and you like it feel free to use it) 

I kinda like the idea of a little background track - if you think no background is better or maybe something more like the 'ambient' clip in the not using folder we can totally do that 

the text letter appear sound is for each letter of the text appearing on screen - not sure how that works programming wise. But this one definitely has to be randomly pitched up/down a tiny bit every time its played. You can play with the overall baseline pitch of where it gets randomized from but I think it will probably sound bad if it just plays unmodified because it will be triggered soooo often 

the click sounds I imagine would be used for clicking on stuff - you could pick a few you like and have one randomly play when player clicks. Also clicks 1/2, 3 /4, and 5/6 kind of work as pairs, so each of those pairs could be the click sounds for a different part of the ui (and you just randomly pick one or the other) I would use a litttle bit of pitch offset (randomize the pitch up or down a tiny bit whenever you play) but if thats too complicated it will probably be fine - if i were doing it I would probably just make a playSound function that lets you randomly offset pitch and also lets you pass a folder and randomly chooses a sound

the event change sounds are for the sort of splash screens when it changes - I didn't count how many there actually were but its easy for me to make a few more if needed
